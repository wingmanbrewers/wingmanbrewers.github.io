# Wingman Brewers Website

Nothing special here.  A few of us behind Wingman Brewers are avid Github users and this was
an easy way to host our website while we're looking for a longer-term solution that our more
non-technical users can also interact with.

If you like good beer and live in the Seattle/Tacoma area, please feel free to drop in and
have a pint:
