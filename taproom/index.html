    <h1>Wingman Brewers Taproom</h1>

    <p>
        Our taproom and brew house are open Tuesday through Sunday. Come down and sample our beers,
        enjoy a pint, and go home with a growler.  We always have our own beer on tap, and do our
        best to include a guest beer or two along with a craft hard cider for your friends who
        aren't so fond of barley.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though we don't serve food, you're more than welcome to bring your own.
        You will often find a local food truck parked out front, and there are a variety of great restaurants nearby which offer take-out and delivery options.
    </p>
