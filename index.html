<h2 class="tagline">Authentic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-Crafted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless.</h2>
<p>
Inspired by Tacoma's legacy of honest hard work, Wingman Brewers strives to create a strong selection of spirited,
full-flavored beers for the South Sound region.
</p>
<p>
You can find our brews on tap at our taproom and many of the great restaurants and watering holes in and around Tacoma.
Keep a look out for our distinctive bomb-shaped tap handle, and don't feel shy mentioning us to your bar tender if you
don't see it.  Our cans and bottles are available at select retail locations around the Puget Sound region.
