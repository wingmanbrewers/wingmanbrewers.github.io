            At Wingman Brewers, we love making beer and sharing it with people.  You can find our brews on tap at our
            taproom and many of the great restaurants and watering holes in and around Tacoma. Keep a look out for our
            distinctive bomb-shaped tap handle, and don't feel shy mentioning us to your bar tender if you don't see it.
            Our cans and bottles are available at select retail locations around the Puget Sound region.

            Tacoma is a special place for all of us.  We've lived here for most of our lives and would be exceedingly happy
            to live and work in Tacoma from the cradle to the grave.  Part of every sale goes to benefit Tacoma charities.
            This is our community, and as both residents and business owners we want to see Tacoma thrive.
